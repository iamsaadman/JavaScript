        ============================
        JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
        ============================

        Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations:

        1. Addition (+)
           Adds two values.
           Example: 5 + 3 = 8

        2. Subtraction (-)
           Subtracts one value from another.
           Example: 10 - 4 = 6

        3. Multiplication (*)
           Multiplies two values.
           Example: 6 * 2 = 12

        4. Division (/)
           Divides one value by another.
           Example: 10 / 2 = 5

        5. Modulus (%)
           Returns the remainder of a division.
           Example: 10 % 3 = 1

        6. Exponentiation (**)
           Raises the first operand to the power of the second.
           Example: 2 ** 3 = 8
        */

        ============================
        JavaScript Assignment Operators
        ============================

        Assignment operators assign values to variables:

        1. =   (Assignment)
           Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
           Example: x = 5

        2. +=  (Addition Assignment)
           Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result.
           Example: x += 3 is same as x = x + 3

        3. -=  (Subtraction Assignment)
           Subtracts the right operand from the left and assigns the result.
           Example: x -= 2 is same as x = x - 2

        4. *=  (Multiplication Assignment)
           Multiplies both operands and assigns the result.
           Example: x *= 4 is same as x = x * 4

        5. /=  (Division Assignment)
           Divides the left operand by the right and assigns the result.
           Example: x /= 2 is same as x = x / 2

        6. %=  (Modulus Assignment)
           Takes the modulus using both operands and assigns the result.
           Example: x %= 3 is same as x = x % 3

        7. **= (Exponentiation Assignment)
           Raises the left operand to the power of the right and assigns the result.
           Example: x **= 2 is same as x = x ** 2

        // Example values (you can uncomment these to test)
        /*
        let x = 10;
        let y = 3;

        console.log("Addition:", x + y);          // 13
        console.log("Subtraction:", x - y);       // 7
        console.log("Multiplication:", x * y);    // 30
        console.log("Division:", x / y);          // 3.33
        console.log("Modulus:", x % y);           // 1
        console.log("Exponentiation:", x ** y);   // 1000

        let z = 5;
        z += 2;  // z = 7
        z -= 1;  // z = 6
        z *= 3;  // z = 18
        z /= 2;  // z = 9
        z %= 4;  // z = 1
        z **= 2; // z = 1
