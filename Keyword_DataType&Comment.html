    <!-- 
        Keyword:
        A keyword is a reserved word in a programming language that has a special meaning. 
        It cannot be used as a variable or function name.
        Examples: if, else, for, while, return
    -->

    <!-- 
        Data Type:
        A data type defines the type of data a variable can hold. 
        It tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.
        Examples: int, float, char, string, bool
    -->

    <!-- 
        Comment:
        A comment is a note written in the code to explain what it does. 
        It is ignored during execution and is only for the programmer’s understanding.
        Examples:
        // This is a single-line comment (C, C++, Java)
        /* This is a multi-line comment */ (C, C++, Java)
        # This is a comment (Python)
    -->

         <h1>Programming Basics: Keyword, Data Type, and Comment</h1>

    <h2>1. Keyword</h2>
    <p>
        A <strong>keyword</strong> is a reserved word in a programming language that has a predefined meaning. 
        These words cannot be used as variable names or identifiers because they are part of the language's syntax.
        <br>Examples: <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>return</code> in languages like C, C++, Java, or Python.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Type</h2>
    <p>
        A <strong>data type</strong> specifies the type of data a variable can hold. 
        It determines the kind of operations that can be performed on the data and how much memory it occupies.
        <br>Common examples:
        <ul>
            <li><code>int</code> – for integers</li>
            <li><code>float</code> – for decimal numbers</li>
            <li><code>char</code> – for single characters</li>
            <li><code>string</code> – for sequences of characters (in higher-level languages)</li>
            <li><code>bool</code> – for true/false values</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>3. Comment</h2>
    <p>
        A <strong>comment</strong> is a programmer-readable note written in the source code to explain the code or make it more understandable. 
        Comments are ignored by the compiler/interpreter and do not affect program execution.
        <br>Examples:
        <ul>
            <li>Single-line comment in C/C++/Java: <code>// This is a comment</code></li>
            <li>Multi-line comment in C/C++/Java: <code>/* This is a multi-line comment */</code></li>
            <li>Python comment: <code># This is a Python comment</code></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
